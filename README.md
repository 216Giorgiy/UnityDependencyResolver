UnityDependencyResolver
=======================

A small library that makes it easy to use Unity in WebAPI as the dependency resolver. It works as a owin Middelware and can be looked up in Owin Startup Configuration.


The library is really small and its someting I use in my own development process instead of copying code around.

Use it as you see fit. 

Happy user of MyGet Build Service. It makes me productive.
